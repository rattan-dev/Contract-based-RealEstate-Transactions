# Contract-based-RealEstate-Transactions

Project Title:
Contract-based RealEstate Transactions

---

Project Description:
This project involves creating a smart contract to facilitate secure real estate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract allows property owners to list their properties, and buyers can transfer ownership by paying the listed price in Ether. The contract ensures that transactions are transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof by leveraging blockchain technology.

---

Project Vision:
The vision of this project is to simplify the real estate transaction process, making it more transparent, efficient, and accessible. By using blockchain, the contract eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and providing a secure, decentralized way for property transactions.

---

Key Features:
1. Property Listing: Owners can add properties to the system with a unique ID, name, and price.
2. Ownership Transfer: Buyers can purchase a property by transferring Ether to the sellerâ€™s address, which is verified in the contract.
3. Property Details Retrieval: Anyone can fetch the details of a property, including its current owner and price.
4. Event Logging: Each ownership transfer is logged in the blockchain through an event, ensuring traceability.

---

Future Scope:
1. Auction Mechanism: The contract could be extended to support auction-style transactions, where multiple buyers can bid for a property.
2. Mortgage Integration: Future versions could integrate mortgage payments or escrow mechanisms to handle more complex transactions
